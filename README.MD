![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prograde-viewsource/prograde-angular-app/master/preview.png)

A starter pack for awesome applications.

  - Cool
  - Spiffy
  - Fancy

Not to mention:
  - Robust
  - Extensible
  - 2.0!
  
How to use:

 - npm install (from Node prompt)
 - gulp build (to serve)
 - gulp compile (to get a neat little packaged version)

> I love Prograde's AngularJS base!
